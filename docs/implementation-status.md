# SAGE Implementation Status

**Project**: SAGE (Smart AICTE Governance Engine)  
**Problem Statement**: SIH 26262 — “Integrated AICTE Approval Workflow Automation, Compliance Monitoring and Alert Management System”  
**Current Phase**: **Phase 4 Complete & Verified (Compliance Monitoring, Deadline Automation, Alert Management & Verification)**  
**Last Updated**: October 2026  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Phase 4 of SAGE has been fully implemented, tested, verified end-to-end, and documented across all three architectural tiers:
- **Regulatory Deadline Management Engine**: Sourced from APH 2024–27 clauses (10-day Scrutiny deficiency rectification, 10-day SHC representation, 7-day SAC appeal, certificate renewals). Features optimistic locking, recalculation history logging with mandatory statutory justification, and automated status transitions (`PENDING` → `DUE_SOON` → `DUE_TODAY` → `OVERDUE`).
- **Multi-Channel Alert & Notification Engine**: Pluggable channel adapters (`IN_APP`, `EMAIL`), SHA-256 composite deduplication hash preventing notification storms, officer acknowledgement receipt tracking, and supervisory escalation to Regional HQ.
- **Continuous Compliance Surveillance Engine**: Scans institutional profiles and applications for expired Fire Safety NOCs (APH Clause 2.1.2), missing mandatory documents, unresolved scrutiny deficiencies, and low OCR confidence flags.
- **Background Scheduling & Concurrency Safety**: Spring `@EnableScheduling` with atomic concurrency guards preventing overlapping executions across cluster nodes, with secured admin manual trigger endpoints.
- **Frontend Integration**: Dedicated `/alerts` center, `/compliance` monitoring dashboard, notification bell with live unread badge, and overview cards on the Dashboard.
- **Verification Status**: **104 / 104 Automated Tests Passing** (66 Spring Boot tests, 15 FastAPI tests, 23 React Vitest tests) with 100% build success, zero ESLint errors, and verified live end-to-end statutory compliance flows.

## 2. Phase 2.1 Remediation Deliverables & Status

| Remediation Area | Identified Vulnerability / Inconsistency | Remediation Architecture | Verification Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Authoritative Authorization Policy** | Blanket cross-institution access for Regional, Scrutiny, EVC, Compliance, and Audit officers | Implemented `AuthoritativeAuthorizationService` checking: identity, authorities, institutional affiliation, regional jurisdiction (`jurisdiction_assignments`), and explicit case assignments (`case_assignments`) | `TenancyAuthorizationEvaluatorTest.java`, `Phase21SecurityRemediationTest.java` (`testRegionalOfficerJurisdictionScoping`, `testCaseAssignmentScopingForComplianceOfficer`) | **VERIFIED** |
| **Statutory Committee Alignment** | Conflating application roles with legal committee authority; single generic committee state | Sourced APH 2024-27 Annexure 16 (Clauses 16.1–16.8); implemented `committee_appointments` table for Scrutiny Ch I (Clause 16.3), Scrutiny Ch II (Clause 16.4), EVC (Clause 16.5), SHC/SAC (Clause 16.6), SCSC (Clause 16.7), EC (Clause 16.2), and Council. Membership cannot be inferred from role alone | `V5__authorization_governance_and_aph_alignment.sql`, `Phase21SecurityRemediationTest.java` (`testStatutoryCommitteeAppointmentNorms`) | **VERIFIED** |
| **Authentication Lifecycle & Revocation** | Client-only token clearing; tokens remained usable until expiration | Built `TokenRevocationService` backed by `token_revocations` table and memory cache; verified on `/auth/logout` and enforced in `JwtAuthenticationFilter`. Deactivated users immediately rejected | `Phase21SecurityRemediationTest.java` (`testServerSideTokenRevocationOnLogout`, `testDeactivatedUserTokenRejected`) | **VERIFIED** |
| **Reliable Regulatory Audit** | Best-effort logging on state-changing operations could drop audit trail | Classified audit events into `MANDATORY` and `BEST_EFFORT`. `recordMandatoryEvent` executes within caller transaction with `Propagation.MANDATORY`; throws `AuditPersistenceException` on failure, rolling back the business transaction | `AuditService.java`, `GlobalExceptionHandler.java`, `Phase21SecurityRemediationTest.java` (`testAuditPersistenceFailureAbortsAction`) | **VERIFIED** |
| **Privilege Escalation Defenses** | Non-admins could attempt to assign `ROLE_AICTE_ADMIN` or omit unknown institution links | Enforced `validateRoleAssignmentPrivilege` (emits `PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION_BLOCKED` audit); rejected unknown institution IDs with HTTP 404 Problem Details | `UserService.java`, `Phase21SecurityRemediationTest.java` (`testPrivilegeEscalationBlocked`, `testUnknownInstitutionIdRejected`) | **VERIFIED** |
| **API Safety & Input Defense** | Unbounded pagination and SQL/field injection vulnerability on sorting | Created `PaginationUtils`: strictly enforces `page >= 0`, `1 <= size <= 100`, allowlist of sort fields, and `asc`/`desc` direction. Returns HTTP 400 Problem Details | `PaginationUtils.java`, `Phase21SecurityRemediationTest.java` (`testPaginationAndSortingValidation`) | **VERIFIED** |
| **Production Configuration Integrity** | Potential insecure fallbacks or weak JWT keys in production | `JwtTokenProvider` rejects blank/null or < 32-byte secret without padding; `config.py` rejects dev/weak tokens in `production` mode | `SecurityConfigurationFailureTest.java` (3 tests), `test_security.py` (`test_production_mode_rejects_weak_or_default_service_token`) | **VERIFIED** |

## 4. Phase 3 Readiness Decision

**DECISION: READY FOR PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTATION**

All security and regulatory governance criteria have been remediated, verified, and backed by automated integration tests:
1. Multi-tenant and cross-institution isolation is enforced at both controller and service levels.
2. The role and committee model aligns with Approval Process Handbook 2024-27 Annexure 16.
3. Server-side token revocation and deactivated user enforcement are active.
4. Mandatory regulatory audits are atomic and fail-closed.
5. All 65 tests pass cleanly across backend, automation, and frontend services.
